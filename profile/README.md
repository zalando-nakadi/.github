## Former Nakadi Community Projects

This organization contains/contained projects related to the [Nakadi Event Broker](https://github.com/zalando/nakadi) â€“ client libraries as well as software built for running Nakadi.

As Nakadi was never adopted outside of Zalando (as far as we know) and running it as open source was a significant overhead, we decided to un-open-source it in the beginning of 2024.
As such, these related projects here are also not needed anymore for the general public, and will be (or are already) archived.

Some of them are still used inside the company, and were moved to internal repositories.

**If you are from Zalando**, these links work for you:

Libraries:
* [Fahrschein](https://github.bus.zalan.do/guild-java/fahrschein)
* [Kanadi](https://github.bus.zalan.do/guild-scala/kanadi)
* [Nakadi Producer Spring Boot starter] (TODO)

Internal applications:
* [Nakadi UI](https://github.bus.zalan.do/aruha/nakadi-ui)
* [Bubuku](https://github.bus.zalan.do/aruha/bubuku)

Documentation:
